This is a very old piece of code that I've most likely written sometime in
between 2010 and 2012, when I first tried out Python 3. I recently did some
backup archeology and decided to archive this here, as it is kinda cool and
somewhat clean, source-wise. Original version control history was not part of
the backup, sadly.

It is probably full of bugs, and the included ROM is the only one I appear to
have tested with. However, this specific one still works flawlessly as shown in
the screenshot.
